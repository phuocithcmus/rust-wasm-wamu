# Wamu Core

A Rust implementation of the core [Wamu protocol](https://wamu.tech/specification) for computation of [threshold signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_cryptosystem#Methodology) by multiple [decentralized identities](https://ethereum.org/en/decentralized-identity/#what-are-decentralized-identifiers).

It implements the core sub-protocols (i.e. share splitting and reconstruction, identity authenticated request initiation and verification, identity challenge, quorum approved request initiation and verification and encrypted backup-based share recovery) as well as types, abstractions and utilities for augmentations (e.g. utilities for initializing and verifying identity rotation, quorum-based share recovery and other decentralized identity authenticated requests) as described by the [Wamu protocol](https://wamu.tech/specification).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

**This crate is pre-alpha software developed as a PoC (Proof of Concept) of the [Wamu protocol](https://wamu.tech/specification).
It has NOT been independently audited and/or rigorously tested yet!
It SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION!**

**NOTE:** üöß This project is still work in progress, check back over the next few weeks for regular updates.
